# [Project 1: Churn in the Telecom Industry : Project Overview](https://github.com/Christopherchristopher/Telecommunication-Churn)
Churning is a common and a major business problem facing business in major industries. Whether in the Communication, Real Estate, Health, Aviation, or the Hospitality Industry. A churned customer provides less or zero revenue and also increase competitor market share. So therefore, there is a need to manage churning. Which is why customer retention strategies is at the fore to address this problem. This project aimed at understanding why customers churn and building a predictive model to know what kind of customers will churn next.  It consists of the Exploratory Data Analysis and subsequently, machine learning modeling of churning customers.

I started out by importing our dataset into my Jupyter notebook, and printing out the first five and last five roles just to have an overview of the kind of data I will be working with.

* Exploratory Data Analysis

1.Understand the variables in the dataset: Having an overview understanding of the data by printing the shape, the column values, and the data types of the dataset. 

2.Cleaning the Data: Checking for incomplete dataset and dropping columns where neccessary 

3.Analyse relationships between variables: Analyzing the univariate and bivariate relationship between variables and the target variable (Churn customers).

4.Explore and visualize relationships: Visualizing relationship between variables by plotting diagrams against variables

* Model Building

Model Building Importing the relevant libraries and classifiers.

1.Model Selection : Our problem is a classification problem and so therefore we have decided to go with any of the classification algorithms.: DecisionTreeClassifier

2.Split : Understating our predictors(x) and targets(y) and splitting our dataset accordingly

3.DecisionTreeClassifier: We fit and train our model using this algorithm

4.Model check: We check the accuracy of our model, confusion_matrix and classification report and not satisfied with the accuracy because of how low our accuracy was, we then employed the oversampling technique.

# [Project 2: Staff_Absenteeism in the work Place](https://github.com/Christopherchristopher/Staff_Absenteeism)

This is an Explanatory Data Analysis and a Predictive Machine Learning model  building for absenteeism in the workplace
The business environment is becoming more competitive than it use to be which leads to increase pressure in the workplace.It is then reasonable to say that unacheiveable business goals and the elevated risk of unemployemnent can lead to increase stress levels which affects the employee and his attitude towrard work,This might result to minor ilness which might make the employee be absent from work. We want to develop a  machine learning model that predicts employee abseenteeism from work.
